# 👋 Hello, I'm Uri.

### DevOps Engineer & Infrastructure Builder based in Vietnam.

> *I build reliable systems, automate repetitive tasks, and turn complex infrastructure into manageable code.*

### 👨‍💻 About Me

My journey started in the blockchain space as a Validator and Node Runner, where I learned the importance of **uptime** and **security**. However, I realized my true passion wasn't just maintaining nodes, but architecting the underlying infrastructure that makes them run efficiently.

Today, I have fully transitioned into **DevOps and System Engineering**. I specialize in designing on-premise virtualization clusters, managing distributed databases, and implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC). I don't just use tools; I focus on **why** a tool is needed and **how** to integrate it seamlessly into a production-grade environment.

### 🚀 What I Do

Here is how I approach technology and problem-solving:

* **Virtualization & Orchestration**
    I treat hardware as a flexible resource. My expertise lies in configuring **Proxmox VE** and **VMware ESXi** to create highly available virtual environments. I am also deeply involved in containerization strategies using **Docker** and **Kubernetes** to ensure applications are portable and scalable.

* **Data Reliability & Storage**
    Data is the core of any operation. I have hands-on experience deploying **Apache Cassandra** in Multi-Datacenter simulations to understand eventual consistency and replication strategies. Additionally, I manage enterprise-grade storage solutions like **Synology NAS (RAID 6)** to ensure robust backup and disaster recovery plans.

* **Automation & Consistency**
    If I have to do it twice, I automate it. I use **Ansible** for configuration management and **Terraform** for provisioning. Recently, I've been optimizing VM deployment pipelines using **Cloud-init**, reducing setup time from hours to minutes.

### 🛠 The Toolbox

My preferred stack for building and managing infrastructure:

| Domain | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operating Systems** | Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS), Windows Server (PowerShell expert) |
| **Virtualization** | Proxmox VE, VMware ESXi, KVM |
| **Containerization** | Docker, Kubernetes (K8s), LXC |
| **Databases** | Apache Cassandra (Multi-DC), MariaDB MaxScale, MySQL |
| **IaC & Config** | Ansible, Terraform, Cloud-init, Bash, YAML |
| **Networking** | pfSense, Tailscale, Cloudflare Tunnels, Nginx |
| **Hardware** | Synology RackStation, Enterprise Servers |

### ⚡ The "Home Lab" Philosophy

I believe the best way to learn is by breaking things safely. I maintain a sophisticated Home Lab that mimics a Tier-3 Data Center environment.

* **Current Setup:** A hybrid network of Proxmox nodes and Synology storage, segmented by VLANs.
* **The Goal:** To simulate real-world scenarios—failover, latency handling, and load balancing—before applying them to production systems.
* **Recent Achievement:** Successfully architected a local cloud environment where VMs are auto-provisioned and instantly connected to a central monitoring stack.

### 📚 Current Focus

I am currently compiling a comprehensive **DevOps Knowledge Base**. This is a structured documentation project where I record:
1.  Complex lab scenarios (e.g., replicating Cassandra across subnets).
2.  Troubleshooting logs for obscure Linux/Windows errors.
3.  Best practices for securing internal networks.
